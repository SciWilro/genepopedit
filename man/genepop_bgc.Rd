\usage{
genepop_bgc(genepop, popdef, fname, dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{popdef}{is a dataframe or path to a csv.
This dataframe contains two columns. Column 1 corresponds to the population names. These names
should match the individual IDs (e.g. BON_01  , 110110 would be 'BON'). The next column
has the grouping classification corresponding to each population
defining parental 1 ("P1") parental 2 ("P2") and admixed ("Admixed") populations.
Note the classifications must be exactly as specified (caps sensitive). If populations are omitted from
this dataframe then they will be omitted from the output files.}

\item{fname}{collective name assigned to each of the output files for BGC.
e.g. "Lobster_analysis" woudl result in
"Lobster_analysis_P1.txt","Lobster_analysis_P2.txt", and "Lobster_analysis_Admixed.txt"}

\item{dir}{file path to directory where the BGC files (3) will be saved.}

\item{GenePop}{the genepop data to be manipulated. This can be either a file path
or a dataframe read in with tab seperation, header=FALSE , quote="", and stringsAsFactors=FALSE.
This will the standard genepop format with a the first n+1 rows corresponding the the n loci names,
or a single commma deliminated row of loci names followed by the locus data. Populations are
seperated by "Pop". Each individual ID is linked the the locus data by "  , " and is read in as
as single row (character).}
