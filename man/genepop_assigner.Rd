\usage{
genepop_assigner(GenePop, popgroup = NULL, path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{GenePop}{the genepop data to be manipulated. This can be either a file path
or a dataframe read in with tab separation, header=FALSE , quote="", and stringsAsFactors=FALSE.
This will be the standard genepop format with a the first n+1 rows corresponding to the n loci names,
or a single comma delimited row of loci names followed by the locus data. Populations are
separated by "Pop". Each individual ID is linked to the locus data by " ,  " (space,space space) and is read in as
as a single row (character).}

\item{popgroup}{if specified (Default: NULL) popgroup is a dataframe or path to a csv.
This dataframe contains two columns. Column 1 corresponds to the population names. These names
should match the individual IDs (e.g. BON_01 ,  110110 would be 'BON'). The next column
has the group. These values must be numeric. If groupings are the same as populations then leave as NULL (Default).}

\item{path}{the filepath and filename of output.}
