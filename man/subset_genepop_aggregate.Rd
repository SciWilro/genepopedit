\usage{
subset_genepop_aggregate(GenePop, dirname, subs = NULL, keep = TRUE,
  agPopFrame)
}
\arguments{
\item{GenePop}{the genepop data to be manipulated. This can be either a file path
or a dataframe read in with tab seperation, header=FALSE , quote="", and stringsAsFactors=FALSE.
This will the standard genepop format with a the first n+1 rows corresponding the the n loci names,
or a single commma deliminated row of loci names followed by the locus data. Populations are
seperated by "Pop". Each individual ID is linked the the locus data by "  , " and is read in as
as single row (character).}

\item{subs}{he loci names of interest or a vector
subs <- c("190-56","145_21",456_12") would return loci with these defined names.}

\item{keep}{logical vector which defines whether you want to remove the loci or keep them.
the default is to keep them keep <- TRUE assuming you are removing neutral markers
and only keeping the subs}

\item{agPopFrame}{a dataframe or path to a csv.
This dataframe contains two columns: Column 1 corresponds to the population names.
Here we consider the alpha-numeric characters before the first underscore '_' to be the population name.
so that IDs are "Population_sample#" (e.g. Aqua23_04 = Population Aqua23, individual 4).
These names can be obtained using the genepop_detective function.
The next column has grouping variables. If you don't want to change the grouping just repeat original name.
If the input is a dataframe object from the workspace it must be a data.frame object and therefore will have headers.
e.g.
Opop   AgPop
AAA    Pop1
BBB    Pop1
CCC    CCC
DDD    Pop2
EEE    EEE
FFF    Pop2
GGG    GGG
AAA/BBB & DDD/FFF would be clustered together between population flags in genepop.}

\item{path}{to the output .txt file (e.g."c:/Users/Yourname/Documents/output.txt")}
}
