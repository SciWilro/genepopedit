\title{Genepop subset loci and populations}
\usage{
subset_genepop(GenePop, dirname, subs = NULL, keep = TRUE, sPop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{GenePop}{the genepop file to be manipulated. This will the standard
genepop format with a the first n+1 rows corresponding the the n loci names
followed by the locus data. Populations are seperated by "Pop".
Each individual ID is linked the the locus data by "  , " and is read in as
as single row (character)
e.g.
Stacks Ver 1.0
1
2
3
Pop
Pop01_01  , 120120 110110 110110
Pop01_02  , 100100 110110 110110
Pop
Pop02_01  , 120120 110110 110110
...}

\item{dirname}{directory where the output file will be saved.}

\item{subs}{the loci names of interest or a vector which corresponds the the order of which
they appear in the genepop file.
These can be either the order by which they occur or the exact name of the loci
e.g. subs <-c(1,2,3,4) would return the first 4 loci &
#' @title Genepop subset loci and populations}

\item{keep}{logical vector which defines whether you want to remove the loci or keep them.
the default is to keep them keep <- TRUE assuming you are removing neutral markers
and only keeping the subs}

\item{sPop}{is the populations of interest. Note these are specified in the order which they appear in the
original Genepop file. i.e. first pop = 1 second pop = 2
Examples: numeric - sPop <- c(1,3,4,7) or
the population ID (alpha-numeric code before the underscore). Here we assume conventional
naming of "Population_sample#" e.g. (Aqua01_05: population Aqua01 & sample #5).
          text- sPop <- c("BMR", "GRR","GHR","TRS").}

\item{path}{to the output .txt file (e.g."c:/Users/Yourname/Documents/output.txt")}

\item{GenePop}{the genepop file to be manipulated. This will the standard
genepop format with a the first n+1 rows corresponding the the n loci names
followed by the locus data. Populations are seperated by "Pop".

\item{subs}{he loci names of interest or a vector which corresponds the the order of which
they appear in the genepop file.
These can be either the order by which they occur or the exact name of the loci
e.g. subs <-c(1,2,3,4) would return the first 4 loci
& subs <- c("190-56","145_21",456_12") would return loci with defined names.}

\item{keep}{logical vector which defines whether you want to remove the loci or keep them.
the default is to keep them keep <- TRUE assuming you are removing neutral markers
and only keeping the subs}

\item{sPop}{is the populations of interest. Note these are specified in the order which they appear in the
original Genepop file. i.e. first pop = 1 second pop = 2
Examples: numeric - sPop <- c(1,3,4,7) or
