\usage{
\method{subset}{genepop}(GenePop, subs = NULL, keep = TRUE, dir,
  sPop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{GenePop}{the genepop file to be manipulated. This will the standard
genepop format with a single row input with loci names followed by data.}

\item{subs}{he loci names of interest or a vector which corresponds the the order of which
they appear in the genepop file.
These can be either the order by which they occur or the exact name of the loci
e.g. subs <- c(1,2,3,4) would return the first 4 loci &
subs <- c("190-56","145_21",456_12") would return loci with defined names.}

\item{keep}{logical vector which defines whether you want to remove the loci or keep them.
the default is to keep them (keep <- TRUE) assuming you are removing neutral markers
and only keeping the subs}

\item{sPop}{is the populations of interest. Note these are specified in the order which they appear in the
original Genepop file. i.e. first pop = 1 second pop = 2  or the text based origin
Examples: numeric - \code{sPop <- c(1,3,4,7)}
          text- \code{sPop <- c("BMR", "GRR","GHR","TRS")}.}

\item{dirname}{directory where the output file will be saved.}
