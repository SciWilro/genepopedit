#genepopedit

The goal of **genepopedit** is to provide a simple and flexible tool for
manipulating SNP datasets in R. 

**Use genepopedit to subset a SNP dataset by:**

* removing specified loci

* removing specified populations 

* removing specified individuals

* renaming populations 

* grouping populations

* extracting meta-data
    * population names
    * population counts
    * sample IDs
    * loci names

**Requirement:**
genepopedit functions through the manipulation of multi-locus SNP files structured in the *Genepop* file format <http://genepop.curtin.edu.au/>. Specifically we use the _three number_ format (e.g. 110110) where the six digits correspond two the alleles of an given locus for an individual. Loci names should be each on their own row so that the total number of rows in the _Genepop_ file equals: 

    nrows = nLOCI + nINDIVIDUALS + nPOPULATIONS - 1
    
  _or_
  
    nrows* = nLOCI + nINDIVIDUALS + nPOPULATIONS 
    
_* if STACKS version is not specified_

Most molecular based file formats can be converted to and from *Genepop* through conversion programs such as the R package _adegenet_ <https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/wiki> or the standalone program *PGDspider* <http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/PGDSpider/>. 

**For example:**

*A three locus dataset with two populations and four individuals per population with the STACKS version specified*

    STACKS Version 1.0
    Loci_1
    Loci_2
    Loci_3
    Pop
    BON01  , 120120 110110 110110
    BON02  , 100100 110110 110110
    BON03  , 100100 110110 110110
    BON04  , 100100 110110 110110
    Pop
    TAG01  , 120120 110110 110110
    TAG02  , 120120 110110 110110
    TAG03  , 120120 110110 110110
    TAG04  , 120120 110110 110110

Where each row line is a single row in the input file.

## Contributions:

This package has been develoepd to used by anyone who is looking for a more efficient and **repeatable** method to maniplate large multi-locus datasets. The package is open and I encourage you to tinker and look for improvments. I will do my best to respond to any inquiries, add additional      functions _and-or_ functionality, and improve the efficiency of the functions.

## How to use genepopedit

Download the example genepop data: GenePop file with 10 populations, 30 individuals per population, and 100 Loci.
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/afhbvqmpzwru4ij/genepopedit_examplefile.txt?dl=0>

Read in the data using the following *read.table* code specifics

```r
GenePopData <- read.table("genepopedit_examplefile.txt", header = FALSE, sep = "\t", quote = "", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
Set a directory where the output files will be saved.

```r
output_dir <- "c:/Users/YourName/Documents/GenePopFiles/" 
```
#genepop detective
This function will describe the structure of your genepop data without having to open it in a text editor. Function returns a vector of population names, sample IDs, or Loci names.

Return *population names*
```r
PopNames <- genepop_detective(GenePopData,variable="Pops")
```
Return *population counts*
```r
PopCounts <- genepop_detective(GenePopData,variable="PopNum")
```
Return *sample IDs*
```r
SampleIDs <- genepop_detective(GenePopData,variable="Inds")
```
Return *Loci names*
```r
LociNames <- genepop_detective(GenePopData,variable="Loci")
```

#subset genepop
Analyses have documented Loci *3 15 23 49 62 81 88 & 94* as potentially under selection. Lets create a Genepop file with just these loci. Here our Loci are named in the Loci# (1:100).

```r
#subset the Genepop file and 'keep' the specified 'subs'
subset_genepop(GenePop=GenePopData,
               keep=TRUE,
               subs=c("Loci03","Loci15","Loci23","Loci49","Loci62",
               "Loci81","Loci88","Loci94"),
               dirname=paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_Loci_selection.txt"))
```

Now create a Genepop file which has all loci which aren't in the list of potential loci under selection (inverse of the last subset). Note the only difference
here is the use of keep=FALSE.

```r
#subset the Genepop file and do not 'keep' the specified 'subs'
subset_genepop2(GenePop=GenePopData,
               keep=FALSE,
               subs=c("Loci03","Loci15","Loci23","Loci49","Loci62",
               "Loci81","Loci88","Loci94"),
               dirname=paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_Loci_neutral.txt"))
```

Now lets again select loci under selection but remove populations 3 & 7 (CCC & GGG). To do this we create a list of all populations we want to keep
(e.g. AAA, BBB, CCC ... JJJ)

```r
#use genepop_detective to find the population names
PopNames <- genepop_detective(GenePopData,"Pops")

#create a list of populations you want to keep
PopKeep <- c("AAA","BBB","DDD","EEE","FFF","HHH","III","JJJ")# manual
#or
PopKeep <- setdiff(PopNames,c("CCC","GGG"))# if you have fewer pops to remove

subset_genepop(GenePop=GenePopData,
               keep=TRUE,
               subs=c("Loci03","Loci15","Loci23","Loci49","Loci62",
               "Loci81","Loci88","Loci94"),
               dirname=paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_Loci_selection_popsubset.txt"),
               sPop=PopKeep
               )
```

#subset genepop rename
Now lets change the names of some of the populations. In this example we will rename populations DDD & HHH to YYY & ZZZ. 
We will aslo remove populations BBB & JJJ (*not listed in column 1 of PopRename*). 

```r
#View the population names
genepop_detective(GenePopData,"Pops")

#create a dataframe for renaming. 
#Column 1 = the original population names and the list of populations required.
#Column 2 = the new names. 
PopRename <- data.frame(oPop=c("AAA","CCC","DDD","EEE","FFF","GGG","HHH","III"),
                        newname=c("AAA","CCC","YYY","EEE","FFF","GGG","ZZZ","III"))

subset_genepop_rename(GenePop=GenePopData,
               dirname=paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_renamed.txt"),
               nameframe=PopRename)
```

#subset genepop aggregate
Now lets change the names of some of the populations. In post-analysis will group the populations together for analysis (e.g. STRUCTURE). In this example we will combine populations DDD & EEE as well as FFF & HHH. 
We will aslo remove populations "JJJ" & "GGG" (*not listed in column 1 of PopRename*). No loci will be removed from this dataframe (*subs=NULL*).

```r
#Use genepop_detective to find the meta-data for populations
genepop_detective(GenePopData,"Pops")

#create a dataframe for renaming. 
#Column 1 = the original population names and the list of populations required.
#Column 2 = Grouping variables. 

PopAggregate <- data.frame(oPop=c("AAA","BBB","CCC","DDD","EEE","FFF","HHH","III"),                        agname=c("AAA","Pop1","CCC","Pop1","DDD","Pop2","HHH","Pop2"))

#Recast Genepop format to group populations based on 'PopAggregate'
subset_genepop_aggregate(GenePop=GenePopData,
               subs=NULL,
               dirname=paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_grouped.txt"),
               agPopFrame=PopAggregatee)
```

Now that we have two grouped populations we can use the population rename function to give them a common name

```r
#read in the grouped Genepop file
GenePopData2 <- read.table(paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_grouped.txt"), header = FALSE, sep = "\t", quote = "", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#investigate the population parameters
genepop_detective(GenePopData2,"Pops")

#we can see that "BBB" & "DDD" and "FFF" & "III" are at the end but still have different names. 

#create renaming frame
PopRename <- data.frame(oPop=c("AAA","CCC","EEE","HHH","BBB","DDD","FFF","III"),
                        newname=c("AAA","CCC","EEE","HHH",
                        "Group1","Group1","Group2","Group2"))

#Rename the grouped populations
subset_genepop_rename2(GenePop=GenePopData2,
               dirname=paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_grouped_renamed.txt"),
               nameframe=PopRename)
```

#subset genepop individual
Now lets change remove some individuals samples ("IDs") from the dataframe.
Here we consider the 'individual' ID to be the alpha-numeric code which constitutes
starts each row of data in the genepop format. 
These individuals will be removed using the default (keep = FALSE)
_This function is best run at the beginning of the analysis prior to removal of specific loci or populations._ 

Here we will remove the sample IDs flagged

```r
#Use genepop_detective to see the naming structure.
genepop_detective(GenePopData,"Inds")

#remove individuals.
subset_genepop_indiv(GenePop=GenePopData,
               indiv=c("AAA_01","AAA_03","BBB_20","CCC_21",
               "EEE_03","EEE_26","HHH_25",JJJ_04),
               keep=FALSE,
               dirname=paste0(output_dir,"Genepop_IDsubset.txt"),
               )
```
